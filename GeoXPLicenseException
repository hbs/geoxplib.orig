The GeoXP License Exception is an additional permission under section 7 of the GNU Affero General Public License, version 3.

It applies to a given file that bears a notice stating that the file is governed by that license along with this exception.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under any OSI (Open Source Initiative) approved license into a single combined work, and to convery the resulting work.

The terms of this License and those of the GNU Affero General Public License version 3 will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work, but the work with which it is combined will remain governed by its own OSI approved license. You must also offer all users interacting with the combined work remotely through a computer network (if your version supports such interaction) an opportunity to receive the Corresponding Source of the work combined with the covered work by providing access to the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge, through some standard or customary means of facilitating copying of software. The Corresponding Source will continue to be licensed under its own OSI approved license.
